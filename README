Task is a Clojure library for managing interactive, long-running tasks at the REPL.



Example: Use task by importing it into your namespace:

(ns your.name.space
  (:use [task.core]))


Example: Running a simple task 5 times over 5 seconds

(run {:repeat 5 :pause 1000} (println "Hello task!"))
